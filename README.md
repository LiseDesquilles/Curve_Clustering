# Curve_Clustering

The Curve_Clustering functions can be used in two situations:
  - Curve_Clustering_4_subclasses : Allows to divide CHCs of a database in 4 subclasses, identifiable in PERIPORTAL, PERIVEINEOUS, ECM and STEM
  - Curve_Clustering_2_subclasses : Allows to divide the PERIVEINEOUS CHCs of a database into 2 subclasses : GOOD-PV and BAD-PV

The use of the two codes requires:
  - A database (format: Genes in row, Individuals in columns)
  - OPTIONAL : A CCR object previously calculated by the CurvClust package (allows to gain in calculation time)
